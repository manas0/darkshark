## Addtional Stuff

### Browser Extension

This Browser Extension is a chromium extension coded to log form data and produce heavy traffic on specific sites.

* Form data is logged by the `sniff.js` file. The chrome `webRequest` API has been used for this. You can also send this form data to a remote server, just change the URL in the code.
* Random traffic is generated in the `traffic.js` file. To choose which websites trigger this file, just change the `urls` list at the end of the file. Traffic is generated by calling a fetch request at each request to the url(s) in the list. This triggers an infinite recursive loop exhausting the browser resources.

### Snort Rules

A `rules` file for SNORT to detect basic packet attacks that were coded in darkshark. It can be extended to detect a variety of attacks based on packet contents.
